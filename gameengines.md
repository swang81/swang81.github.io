# TA Techniques

## Unity Shader

This is my shader demos. You can get them from here [[**download**](https://github.com/swang81/JackUnityShaders/)]

### PBR Shader
I rewrite the surface shader, compared it with the surface shader and got similar results.

### Cartoon Shader
I follow GuiltyGear Xrd's Art Style PPT and construct a cartoon shader, which includes diffuse, specular, shading, outline and correct color at last.

### Amplify Shader Pack Chinese Manual
Here I translated the ASE manual to Chinese. Please see [here](/blogs/ase). 

## Game Live Demo

### UE VR Laser Sword
Here we use Oculus Quest 2 + VDS(Virtual Desktop Streamer) + UE4 to build a VR Laser sword demo game.  All logic are base on blueprint. All renderings are done by the host and transmitted through VDS.
[**Please, see here about how to setup the VR develop enviroment for Oculus Quest2**](/blogs/quest2)

<br>
It is a wasteland style gun based on very popular PBR workflow. You can get it from here [[**download**](https://github.com/swang81/MyModels/)]. It contains FBX and all Textures for Unity. The main workflow is as follows: Modeling / UV Editing / Baking / Texturing / Rendering. 


### Stylized Material with SD

This is a demonstration of the results of the  SD stylized Material practice. Various elements will be added later.

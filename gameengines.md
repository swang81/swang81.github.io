# Game Techniques

## Unity Shader

This is my interesting shader collections. You can get them from here [[**download**](https://github.com/swang81/JackUnityShaders/)]

- ### PBR Shader

I rewrote the surface shader for practice with the gun model, compared it with the original one and got similar results. It is very friendly for new learners. It has a lot of comments for you.

- ### Cartoon Shader
![](images/ge/fightplay.gif)
I follow GuiltyGear Xrd's Art Style PPT and construct a cartoon shader, which includes diffuse, specular, shading, outline and correct color at last.

- ### Amplify Shader Pack Chinese Manual
Here I translated the ASE manual to Chinese. Please see [here](/blogs/ase). 


## Game Live Demo

- ### UE4 FPS

- ### UE VR Laser Sword

Here we use Oculus Quest 2 + VDS(Virtual Desktop Streamer) + UE4 to build a VR Laser sword demo game.  All logic are base on blueprint. All renderings are done by the host and transmitted through VDS.

It is a wasteland style gun based on very popular PBR workflow. You can get it from here [[**download**](https://github.com/swang81/MyModels/)]. It contains FBX and all Textures for Unity. The main workflow is as follows: Modeling / UV Editing / Baking / Texturing / Rendering. 


- ### Stylized Material with SD
This is a demonstration of the results of the  SD stylized Material practice. Various elements will be added later.

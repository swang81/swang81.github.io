<br>
As a postdoctoral researcher, we proposed a deformable surface model to simulate the flow behavior of water droplets on different solid surfaces. In the Lagrangian coordinate system, at each time step, the implicit curvature flow operator is used to simulate the surface tension of water, the contact angle operator is used to change the shape of water droplets on the solid surface, and the topological structure of the mesh is optimized to improve the robustness of the mesh. Through a series of numerical experiments, it is proved that real-time rendering can be achieved.  It was published in IEEE.

## First principle study of spin-transfer torques

<br>

<br>

Recent experiments on the tunneling system and magnetic domain wall call for a full quantum treatment of the whole system. We have developed an efficient first-principles method to calculate spin-transfer torques (STTs) in layered system with noncollinear magnetization. The complete scattering wave function is determined by matching the wave function in the scattering region with the Bloch states in the leads. The STTs are obtained with the aid of the scattering wave function.

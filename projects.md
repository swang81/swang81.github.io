<br>
I lead the team to develop the core algorithm( Ray-Casting) based on OpenGL/HLSL and C++ and optimize the algorithm to meet the requirements of real-time 3D rendering of medical image data. Adding subsurface scattering effect to achieve realistic image rendering effect, using NVIDIA DLSS acceleration; supporting various complex interactive operations , such as splitting, hiding, group,etc.

##  Physics Simulation in CG

<br>
As a postdoctoral researcher, we proposed a deformable surface model to simulate the flow behavior of water droplets on different solid surfaces. In the Lagrangian coordinate system, at each time step, the implicit curvature flow operator is used to simulate the surface tension of water, the contact angle operator is used to change the shape of water droplets on the solid surface, and the topological structure of the mesh is optimized to improve the robustness of the mesh. Through a series of numerical experiments, it is proved that real-time rendering can be achieved.  It was published in IEEE.

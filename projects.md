## Volume Rendering Engine

![imageVolumerendering](images/volumerendering.jpg)



I lead the team to develop the core algorithm( Ray-Casting) based on OpenGL/HLSL and C++ and optimize the algorithm to meet the requirements of real-time 3D rendering of medical image data. Adding subsurface scattering effect to achieve realistic image rendering effect, using NVIDIA DLSS acceleration; supporting various complex interactive operations , such as splitting, hiding, group,etc.
